## Overview

This is a two-day hands on workshop designed for experienced R and RStudio users who want to (re)design their R lifestyle. You'll learn holistic workflows that address the most common sources of friction in data analysis. We’ll work on project-oriented workflows, version control for data science (Git/GitHub!), and how to plan for collaboration, communication, and iteration (incl. RMarkdown).

At the conclusion of the workshop, you should have: knowledge of your R installation that enhances your ability to maintain it, workflows that facilitate collaboration with yourself or others (including version control and strategies for file systems), tools to improve debugging processes, and methods to address repetitive tasks with the purrr package.

## Learning objectives

[ADD AN ITEMIZED LIST OF LEARNING OBJECTIVES.]

## Is this course for me?

This course will be appropriate for you if you answer yes to these questions:

- Have you been using R for a while and feel there might be better ways to organize your R life, but don't know what they are?

- Do you want to streamline your workflow for doing analysis and automating repetitive tasks in R?

- Are you willing to get into the weeds of your R installation, project organization, error messages, and source code?

## Prework

\[ADD INFORMATION YOU WANT LEARNERS TO HAVE / STEPS THEY WANT THEM TO
COMPLETE PRIOR TO THE WORKSHOP. THIS COULD BE A LINK TO A THREAD ON
RSTUDIO COMMUNITY, PACKAGE INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS, HOW TO GET AN
RSTUDIO.CLOUD ACCOUNT, ETC.\]
